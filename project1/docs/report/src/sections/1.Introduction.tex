\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This project focuses on the design and implementation of two key components of a database management system: storage and indexing.

Our report is structured as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, we illustrate the design of our storage component, where data is stored in blocks on computer disks.
    \item Next, we describe the implementation of our \bplustree and the process of storing the index on the disk.
    \item Finally, we present the statistics and experimental results obtained using our database system.
\end{enumerate}
